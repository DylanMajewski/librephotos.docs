You can look into the issues [here](https://github.com/LibrePhotos/librephotos/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Amobile),
on what features are missing from the frontend.

The local images to not yet show up in all views. You can help out by adding them to the views by implementing new selectors.

We currently are working on improving maintainability, by converting our code base to TypeScript. There are still alot of classes, which are written in plain JavaScript. You can help out by converting them to TypeScript!

We are in the process of migrating from Redux-Wrapper to redux-toolkit and redux-query.

The long term goal is to use the same state management and API calls for the frontend and the mobile app, which is called single-sourcing.

You can also help by expanding the documentation.
