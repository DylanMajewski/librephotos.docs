## UhuruPhotos

[UhuruPhotos](https://github.com/savvasdalkitsis/uhuruphotos-android) is an native Android client for LibrePhotos written using the latest Android technologies. It is the most feature complete app for LibrePhotos.

It aims to become a full featured photo album replacement, including features like offline support, backup and sync etc.

The app is currently in closed beta on the Google Play store. Contact me kurosavvas on [gitter](https://gitter.im/uhuruphotos/) or [discord](https://discord.gg/xwRvtSDGWb) for access.

## LibrePhotos Mobile

[LibrePhotos Mobile](https://github.com/LibrePhotos/librephotos-mobile) is the offical app, which is at the proof-of-concept stage. It's written in react-native and in the future will share more code with the frontend.

You can download the .apk [here](https://github.com/LibrePhotos/librephotos-mobile/releases/tag/v1.0.3). It is technically possible to compile it to also work on iOS, but nobody stepped up to do that yet.
